# YSBlog
The blog will be on [here](https://yoyoshih.github.io/YSBlog/).  
And the code will be put in the "master" branch.  
The only purpose is that I want to practice React, Node.js, Bootstrap, etc.  
Enhancing my webapp coding skill!  
Hopefully I will keep renewing my blog :)
  
Following is a learning list for me:  
* React
* Node.js
* Bootstrap
* RWD
* pseudo-element
* NoSQL
* SASS/SCSS
