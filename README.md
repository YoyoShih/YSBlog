# YSBlog
The blog is on [here](https://yoyoshih.github.io/YSBlog/).  
(Actually, it's a "PC only" blog... I'm still learning how to use RWD skill!)  
And the code will be put in the "master" branch.  
The only purpose is that I want to practice React, Node.js, Bootstrap, etc.  
Enhancing my webapp coding skill!  
Hopefully I will keep renewing my blog :)
  
Following is a learning list for me:  
* React
* Node.js
* RWD
  * Media queries
  * Fluid grid
  * Fluid image
* pseudo-element
* NoSQL
* SASS/SCSS
